We present the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model designed to unfold and then leverage neural activity as the underlying mechanism for observation and action. Our contributions are:

1. An internal temporal axis, decoupled from any input data, that enables neuron activity to unfold.

2. Neuron-level temporal processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a history of incoming signals, enabling fine-grained temporal dynamics.

3. Neural synchronisation, employed as a direct latent representation for modulating data and producing outputs, thus directly encoding information in the timing of neural activity.

We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet classification, solving 2D mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks.

We provide all necessary code to reproduce our results and invite others to build upon and use CTMs in their own work.

```

## Setup
To set up the environment using conda:

```
conda create --name=ctm python=3.12
conda activate ctm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there are issues with PyTorch versions, the following can be ran:
```
pip uninstall torch
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

## Model training
Each task has its own (set of) training code. See for instance [tasks/image_classification/train.py](tasks/image_classification/train.py). We have set it up like this to ensure ease-of-use as opposed to clinical efficiency. This code is for researchers and we hope to have it shared in a way that fosters collaboration and learning. 

While we have provided reasonable defaults in the argparsers of each training setup, scripts to replicate the setups in the paper will typically be found in the accompanying script folders. If you simply want to dive in, run the following as a module (setup like this to make it easy to run many high-level training scripts from the top directory):

```
python -m tasks.image_classification.train
```
For debugging in VSCode, this configuration example might be helpful to you:
```
{
    "name": "Debug: train image classifier",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "launch",
    "module": "tasks.image_classification.train",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "justMyCode": false
}
```


## Running analyses

We also provide analysis and plotting code to replicate many of the plots in our paper. See `tasks/.../analysis/*` for more details on that. We also provide some data (e.g., the mazes we generated for training) and checkpoints (see [here](#checkpoints-and-data)). Note that ffmpeg is required for generating mp4 files from the analysis scripts. It can be installed with:
```
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```


## Checkpoints and data
You can download the data and checkpoints from here: 
- checkpoints: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vSg8T7FqP-guMDk1LU7_jZaQtXFP9sZg
- maze data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cBgqhaUUtsrll8-o2VY42hPpyBcfFv86/view?usp=drivesdk

Checkpoints go in the `checkpoints` folder. For instance, when properly populated, the checkpoints folder will have the maze checkpoint in `checkpoints/mazes/...`
